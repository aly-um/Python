""" Subsetting dataframes
The following demonstrates how to subset a dataframe from an existing dataset
"""

# Loads necessary packages

# Loads the taxi.csv dataset
taxicabsNY = pd.read_csv('taxi.csv')

# Subset a column of the taxicabsNY dataframe by specifying the column name

# Prints the column
print(distance)



""" Using iloc
This code uses the iloc() method to subset the data
"""

# Loads necessary packages

# Loads the taxi.csv dataset
cabsNY = pd.read_csv('taxi.csv')

# Subset cabsNY using the iloc method

# Loads necessary packages

taxicabsNY = pd.read_csv('taxi.csv')

# Subset taxicabsNY by specifying columns and rows using the loc method

# Prints the column

""" Using relational operators
This method subsets the data by using the relational operator "<"

# Loads necessary packages

# Prints the column
print(df)



""" Using comparison and logical operators
This code subsets the data by using the comparison operators "==" and the logical operators "&" and "|"
to return any instances in which the dropoff borough is Brooklyn, and the pickup zone is either Rego Park or Little Italy/NoLiTa.
